This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# Starts the development server.
```

```bash
npm run build
# Builds the app for production.
```

```bash
npm start
# Runs the built app in production mode.
```
